Pretty important:
only save nodes if there's something unusal about them, only applies for the devotion jewels (militant faith or lethal pride)
make mod_fixer handle all jewels
-- mod_fixer handles them mostly well. For the jewels that add devotion, and when they don't change the notable, 
-- but the name is misread, the name of the notable should appear in the list of valid options.

Minor improvements:
remove non-alpha numeric characters from beginning and end.
-- lots of failures are ".... stunned." or "'12% increased ..."
#some specific changes: Ayoid -> Avoid, iricreased -> increased, Scunned -> Stunned, Chance -> chance

move the duplicate skip further outside the loop

soup up "of the vaal" mod lists to account for triple (or QUADRUPLE?!?) mods
make sure there's enough delay between putting in the jewel and arriving at the first node for the server/effect to change the nodes.
-- this seems lag-dependent. Could do a very fast image detection. dunno
add confirm changes option when closing mod_fixer

config:
config (yml) for finding jewel/node/socket combinations
set up config for unlocked jewel sockets

external tools:
add pob import option


notes:
flask for self-server (python/javascript integration?)
tornado (more complicated, same as flask?)

170 sec per jewel for brutal restraint
300 sec per jewel for glorious vanity
